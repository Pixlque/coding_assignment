Creating a todo list using Elixir Phoenix LiveView is a great way to explore real-time web development. Here's a coding assignment tailored for that:

### Task:
Develop a real-time todo list web application using Elixir, Phoenix framework for the backend and LiveView for the frontend.

### Requirements:

#### Backend (Elixir and Phoenix):
1. Set up a Phoenix LiveView project.
2. Implement CRUD operations for tasks using LiveView.
3. Use Ecto for database operations. You can use SQLite or PostgreSQL as the database.
4. Implement real-time updates for task creation, deletion, and completion using LiveView.
5. Implement validation for task creation (e.g., title should not be empty).
6. Write tests for the backend using ExUnit.

#### Frontend (HTML/CSS/Liveview):
1. Design a simple UI for the todo list.
2. Use LiveView hooks or JavaScript to handle user interactions such as task creation, deletion, and completion.
3. Display tasks dynamically without page reloads.
4. Implement form validation for task creation.
5. Style the UI using CSS to make it visually appealing.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure proper error handling and feedback to the user.
- Maintain code organization and adhere to best practices.
- Provide clear instructions for running the application locally.
- Explore the use of LiveView features such as live navigation and live redirects.
- Consider implementing features like task filtering or sorting for extra credit.

This assignment offers an opportunity to delve into real-time web development with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView while building a practical and interactive todo list application.
